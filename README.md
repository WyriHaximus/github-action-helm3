# Helm Github Action

Runs given Helm/shell commands after ensuring Helm and kubectl are installed or pull in it's own. 

![Example output showing this action in action](images/output.png)

## Options

This action supports the following options.

### exec

The shell commands to run.

* *Required*: `Yes`
* *Type*: `string`
* *Example*: `helm version`

## kubeconfig

The contents of the `~/.kube/config` used by kubectl and helm to authenticate and communicate with your kubernetes
cluster. *Note: this can be empty if you want to use this action to do helm lints. The contents of this input will
be appended to `~/.kube/config`, and will always be removed afterwards.*

* *Required*: `no`
* *Type*: `string`

## Output

This action has only one output and that's the `number` output. This is the number you see in the HTML URL of the
milestone and can be used to refer to in other actions when creating PR's as shown in the example below.

## Examples

The following example is triggered on the tagging of a new release and update the helm charts `appVersion` to the tag
title before calling helm to install the application in `./.helm/app/` to kubernetes:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy
        uses: WyriHaximus/github-action-helm3@v3
        with:
          exec: helm upgrade APP_NAME ./.helm/app/ --install --wait --atomic --namespace=APP_NAMESPACE --values=./.helm/app/values.yaml
          kubeconfig: '${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}'
```

The following example shows how you can use this action to lint your helm files in (for example) `./.helm/app/`.

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
jobs:
  lint-helm:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Lint Helm
        uses: WyriHaximus/github-action-helm3@v3
        with:
          exec: helm lint ./.helm/app/
```
